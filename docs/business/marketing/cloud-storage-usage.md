# 🗃️ Dunosis Media Cloud Storage - Usage Guidelines

Welcome to the Dunosis Cloud Storage! 🎉 This guide outlines how we organize, store, and manage all media content for our marketing projects. Our goal is to keep everything accessible, organized, and secure as we grow our creative portfolio.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the Archive
The Dunosis Wasabi Cloud Storage is designed to:

- 🗂️ **Store all finalized and raw media content** for long-term safekeeping
- 🤝 **Enable easy collaboration and retrieval** of files
- 💾 **Free up space** on local drives and Google Drive
- 🔐 **Securely back up** files in case of data loss

This archive is not for daily editing, but rather for:

- Finalized deliverables
- Archived raw footage/images
- Project backups

---

## 🔁 Storage Workflow
Here’s how we move files through the system:

1. **🎞️ Local Editing**  
   Work on photos/videos locally for speed (e.g., culling, editing, exporting).

2. **📤 Google Drive (Collaboration)**  
   Upload *final edits* to Google Drive for review, collaboration, or client access.

3. **📦 Wasabi Archive (Long-Term Storage)**  
   Upload both *RAW* files and *Final Edits* to Wasabi for permanent backup.

## 📁 Folder Structure & Naming Conventions

```
marketing/
├── client-name-1/
│   ├── project-name-YYYYMMDD/
│   │   ├── raw/
│   │   └── final/
│   └── ...
├── client-name-2/
│   ├── project-name-YYYYMMDD/
│   │   ├── raw/
│   │   └── final/
│   └── ...
```

### 🧭 Guidelines:
- Use **client's full name or business name** for the folder name
- For projects: `project-name-YYYYMMDD` (e.g., `summer-shoot-20250315`)
- Keep **raw** and **final** content separated
- Avoid storing working/temporary files

---

## 🕓 Timeline: When to Upload Files

### ✅ **Weekly Review**
- Every Friday, review any completed projects or finalized edits
- Upload both RAW files and final exports to the appropriate archive folder

### 🧹 **Post-Project Wrap-Up**
- Within 2 days of completing a project:
  - Upload RAW files from local storage
  - Upload final versions from Google Drive

### 🔁 **Monthly Maintenance**
- Check that new client/project folders follow naming conventions
- Reorganize anything out of place
- Confirm that all work-in-progress files have been archived properly
