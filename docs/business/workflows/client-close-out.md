!!! warning ":construction: Under Construction :construction:"

    This section is still under construction. Facts, information, and data in here may not be complete or accurate yet. 

This workflow documentation outlines the process of closing out a web-development client. It will include a checklist of tasks, templates, and structures to make this process as efficient as possible. 

## 1. Project Deliverables Review

### Overview
Before finalizing a project and handing it over to the client, we conduct a **Project Deliverables Review** to ensure all aspects of the website or application are fully functional, optimized, and meet our quality standards. This step ensures that the client receives a polished, professional product ready for public use.

## 2. Client Approval Process

### Overview  
The **Client Approval Process** is a crucial step before officially closing out the project. This meeting ensures that the client has reviewed the deliverables, tested the functionality, and is satisfied with the outcome. It also provides an opportunity to address any last-minute questions or minor adjustments.

---

### üìÖ Scheduling the Final Walkthrough  

To finalize the project, schedule a **Client Approval Meeting** that includes:  

‚úÖ A live walkthrough or recorded video presentation of the final product  
‚úÖ A review of all **Project Deliverables** (checklist completed in the previous step)  
‚úÖ An opportunity for the client to **test functionality** and provide final feedback  

**Best Practices for Scheduling:**  
- **Preferred Format**: Video call (Zoom, Google Meet) or in-person if local  
- **Attendees**: Client, project manager, and key team members  
- **Agenda**: Structured to review final deliverables and next steps  
- **Duration**: 30-60 minutes depending on project complexity  

---

### üìù Client Approval Process  

Once the walkthrough is complete, obtain **official client approval** to mark the project as complete.  

#### üìå Approval Options  
1. **Verbal Approval**  
   - Ideal for small projects or clients with ongoing contracts.  
   - Confirm in writing via **email** with a summary of the meeting and next steps.  

2. **Written Approval (Recommended for Final Close-Out)**  
   - Send a **Client Approval Form** that includes:  
     - Final project description  
     - Confirmation that all deliverables meet the agreed-upon requirements  
     - Acknowledgment of transition to post-launch support (if applicable)  
   - Approval can be collected via:  
     - **Email Confirmation** (Client replies ‚ÄúApproved‚Äù)
