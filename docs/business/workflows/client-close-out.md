!!! warning ":construction: Under Construction :construction:"

    This section is still under construction. Facts, information, and data in here may not be complete or accurate yet. 

This workflow documentation outlines the process of closing out a web-development client. It will include a checklist of tasks, templates, and structures to make this process as efficient as possible. 

## 1. Project Deliverables Review

### Overview
Before finalizing a project and handing it over to the client, we conduct a **Project Deliverables Review** to ensure all aspects of the website or application are fully functional, optimized, and meet our quality standards. This step ensures that the client receives a polished, professional product ready for public use.
